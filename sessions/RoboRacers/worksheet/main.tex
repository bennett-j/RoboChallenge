    Welcome to RoboRacers! Today, we're going to use the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot and try to race it around the racetrack! Before we can start racing, we will need to think about how the robot will see the racetrack. But first we need to master moving our robot around. So let's get going...

    Look out for these boxes:
    \notebox{Information boxes give useful information about the robot.}
    \tipbox{Hint boxes give tips to to help you complete the tasks.}
    \thinkbox{Think boxes give you something to think about and maybe an extra challenge.}
