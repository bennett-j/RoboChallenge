name: RoboRacers-Algorithms
description: This one is designed to make you think! First we get to grips with writing programs that make robots move around. We then understand how a sensor allows the robot to see the world. Finally we design algorithms that tell the robot how to use the sensor information to race along a line.
objectives:
- Learn how to _create_ and _run_ programs for the robot.
- Master moving the robot around.
- Learn how robots can "see" the world with a _reflectance sensor_.
- Design your own algorithms and write them as a programs to run on the robot.
- Race around the racetrack and tune the robot so it completes it a well as possible.
suitability: Understanding of basic programming concepts such as loops and conditionals is required. Mathematically inclined students will find this session more engaging. Suitable for later secondary school ages and above.
