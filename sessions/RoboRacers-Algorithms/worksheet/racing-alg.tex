Now it's time to get our robot to race the track by following the line!

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open \vb{racing.py} and input the same values for \code{LINE\_REF} and \code{BACKGROUND\_REF}. 
\item Design an algorithm and write the rest of the program so your robot will be the fastest around the racetrack!
\end{enumerate}
