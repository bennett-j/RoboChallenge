# RoboRacers-Algorithms v2.0

This one is designed to make you think! First we get to grips with writing programs that make robots move around. We then understand how a sensor allows the robot to see the world. Finally we design algorithms that tell the robot how to use the sensor information to race along a line.

## Objectives

In this challenge you will:

- Learn how to _create_ and _run_ programs for the robot.
- Master moving the robot around.
- Learn how robots can "see" the world with a _reflectance sensor_.
- Design your own algorithms and write them as a programs to run on the robot.
- Race around the racetrack and tune the robot so it completes it a well as possible.

## Instructions

Follow the `RoboRacers-Algorithms.pdf` worksheet, using the programs in this release.

## Session Details

- **Name**: RoboRacers-Algorithms
- **Version**: v2.0
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes
- **Suitable for**: Understanding of basic programming concepts such as loops and conditionals is required. Mathematically inclined students will find this session more engaging. Suitable for later secondary school ages and above.
